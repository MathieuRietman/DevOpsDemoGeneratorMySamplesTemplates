## Introduction

Security will be largely implemented through policy-driven management. The proposed  \<\<customer name>\>'s policies ensure that new subscriptions and resources immediately comply with the compliant state. By using "deployIfNotExists", "deny", "append", and "modify" the Azure resources are made compliant with regard to the Azure platform (Logging, Public Endpoints, Agent install etc).

- With "deployIfNotExist" policies,  *custname* IaaS and PaaS resources, as well as new subscriptions, resources become compliant when created regardless of how they were created.

- With the "deny" policies,  *custname* ensures that there is no misconfiguration. This will cause the deployment to fail and thus prevent non-compliant resource configurations from occurring
  
- With "append" policies, necessary tags are added to resources without user interaction, eg for appropriate cost center tags.

- With the "modify" policies,  *custname* changes can be made to resource tags

Advice is to start with "audit" and "auditIfNotExists" policies to understand current status and compliance, and deploy if not exist for agents and monitoring configurations.

- Security is non-negotiable
Policies enforce enforcement.

The following security policies and governance are used:

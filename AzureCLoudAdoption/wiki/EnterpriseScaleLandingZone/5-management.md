## Introduction

The monitoring strategy is to use the services available in the Azure platform for logging, security and network monitoring. This means using the Azure native services such as Log Analytics, Monitor, Security Center, Sentinel and Network Watcher.

All core management infrastructure will be in a dedicated Management subscription and governed by Azure Policy; the Monitoring configurations for IAAS and PAAS workloads and subscriptions are policy driven by Azure policy.

Two different management subscriptions will be created for different Log Analytics retention policies. Dev / Test with standard 90 days Acc / Prod with a minimum of 365 days.

See diagram of the components in the management subscription: 


![Monitoring Subscription](../media/management.png)

The centralized platform management is the hub for all security and networking monitoring data from IAAS and PAAS components in Azure. With this implementation one achieves:

* A single, central, and horizontal view of the platform on security, auditing, and networking, enforced through Azure Policy and "deployIfNotExists".
   * Consume security data centrally from all subscriptions.
   * Consume networking data centrally from all subscriptions with network deployments.
* Granular data retention per data table in Log Analytics.
* Resource centric and granular RBAC for application teams to access their monitoring data.
* Emergency VM patching and granular VM patching for application teams per RBAC.
* Centralized alerting.
* Centralized, interactive Azure dashboards

AppDevOps Teams can deploy for application performance monitoring Application Insight along with the application and their environment. Optional when central IAAS and PAAS logging require more detail an additional Log Analytics can be deployed in the application subscription.

The following components will be deployed in the management group.
